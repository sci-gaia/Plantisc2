<h2>Tedious Laboratory experiments</h2>

<p>

Plant tissue culture is still in its empirical stage, involving a lot of trials and error.</p>

<p>

This portal provides a 70% accurate means of simulating the desired concentration mixture .

<p><p><p><p><p>

</br>
</p>
</br>
<h2>Cost Efficiency</h2>

<p>
Due to the number of trials required for Plant tissue culture experiments, the cost of infrastructure and material resources are also high.
</p>
<p>
This portal reduces the experimental cost to a large extent.
</p>
<br></br>
<h2>Experiment Time management</h2>

<p>
The experiment is time and material intensive, running into several months of laboratory efforts to 
build hormonal combinations that will be best for mass propagation of a particular plant specie.
<p>

</p>
<br></br>
<h2>Prediction of Culture mixture</h2>

<p>
This portal simply simulates and predicts the desired hormonal combinations using the provided input data. A two variable multi-Regression was used for the prediction.
<p>
The simulation time is dependent on the user's input data.
